        "\n",
        "Advanced prompting techniques can dramatically improve LLM performance on complex reasoning tasks. These patterns guide the model to think more carefully and produce more accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Three Key Techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Zero-Shot Chain of Thought (Zero-Shot CoT)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it is:** Simply adding \"Let's think step by step\" to your prompt encourages the model to break down its reasoning process without providing any examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use:**\n",
        "- Medical diagnosis assistance\n",
        "- Financial risk assessment\n",
        "- Legal document analysis\n",
        "- Complex decision-making tasks\n",
        "- When you don't have example solutions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight:** This simple phrase activates the model's reasoning capabilities without requiring any training or examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Few-Shot Chain of Thought (Few-Shot CoT)**\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it is:** Providing a few examples that demonstrate step-by-step reasoning, then asking the model to solve a new problem using the same reasoning pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use:**\n",
        "- Domain-specific problems (medical, legal, financial)\n",
        "- When you want consistent reasoning format\n",
        "- Complex tasks that benefit from examples\n",
        "- When zero-shot doesn't perform well enough\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight:** Examples teach the model both the reasoning process AND the expected output format.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Self-Consistency**\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it is:** Generate multiple reasoning paths with different temperatures (0.3, 0.6, 0.9), then use another LLM to consolidate the results and select the most consistent answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When to use:**\n",
        "- High-stakes medical decisions\n",
        "- Financial investment analysis\n",
        "- Legal case evaluation\n",
        "- When you need confidence in the result\n",
        "- Reducing hallucinations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight:** Multiple perspectives with different creativity levels, consolidated by a deterministic model, produce more reliable results.\n",

Majority Conclusion**\n\nAll three analyses reach the same conclusion:  \n**The Buyer cannot legally cancel the order without penalty and cannot claim breach of contract.** The Supplier’s delivery, although delayed beyond the original 30 business days, was made within the extended timeframe allowed by the force majeure clause and before the 45-business-day cancellation threshold.\n\n---\n\n**2. Key Supporting Arguments**\n\n- **Force Majeure Clause Suspension:** The contract explicitly states that the delivery timeline is subject to force majeure events. The declared state of emergency due to the severe snowstorm qualifies as a force majeure event, suspending or extending the delivery deadline.\n\n- **Exclusion of Force Majeure Days:** The 7 business days during the snowstorm (Feb 1-10) are excluded from the business day count, effectively extending the delivery deadline by those days.\n\n- **Adjusted Delivery Deadline:**  \n  - Original delivery deadline: 30 business days from January 15 (~Feb 26).  \n  - Adding 7 force majeure days extends this to approximately 37 business days (~March 6).\n\n- **Cancellation Threshold:** Buyer may cancel only if delivery exceeds 45 business days (excluding force majeure days). The actual delivery occurred on the 43rd business day (excluding force majeure days), which is within the cancellation threshold.\n\n- **No Breach of Contract:** Since the Supplier delivered within the extended deadline and before the cancellation threshold, the delay is excused, and no breach has occurred.\n\n---\n\n**3. Final Recommendation**\n\n**The Buyer does not have a contractual right to cancel the order without penalty nor to claim breach of contract based on the delivery delay.** The Supplier’s delivery on March 15, 2024, complies with the contract terms when accounting for the force majeure event. The Buyer’s cancellation demand and breach claim should be rejected.\n\n---\n\nIf needed, a formal legal memo or response can be drafted to communicate this position to the Buyer or relevant parties."
